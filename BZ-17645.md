# BZ-17645 Patch
## Summary
This patch resolves a performance issue that affects MATLAB and Simulink shutdown performance. The patch provides a new sorting algorithm for shared objects in the dynamic loader. The original algorithm in glibc versions prior to glibc 2.35 is slow when the DSO set contains circular dependencies.

## Bug Description 
The performance issue impacts the MATLAB and Simulink shutdown time. In a Debian 11 environment using glibc 2.31, the MATLAB and Simulink shutdown time is about 300 seconds with modern hardware. With the same setup and the patch enabled, the shutdown time is less than 3 seconds. The performance issue was first reported in November of 2014 by Paulo Andrade. For more information, see [RFE: Improve performance of dynamic loader for deeply nested DSO dependencies](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17645). 

## Patch Sources
This patch contains a new implementation of _dl_sort_maps, which Paulo Andrade introduced in [RFE: Improve performance of dynamic loader for deeply nested DSO dependencies](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17645). Chung-Lin Tang <cltang@codesourcery.com> and Adhemerval Zanella <azanella@sourceware.org> later incorporated the new implementation into the master branch of glibc 2.35 in the commit [elf: Fix slow DSO sorting behavior in dynamic loader (BZ #17645)](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;h=15a0c5730d1d5aeb95f50c9ec7470640084feae8).

The MathWorks BZ-17645 patch sets the new DFS sorting algorithm as the default behavior.

## Acknowledgements and Thanks
Many thanks to the glibc team and, particularly, Paulo Andrade for reporting the issue and providing the original implementation and Chung-Lin Tang and Adhemerval Zanella for incorporating the new sorting algorithm into glibc 2.35 and providing the original patch.

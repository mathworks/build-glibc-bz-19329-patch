# BZ-17645 Patch
## Summary
This patch provide a new sorting algorithm for shared objects in the dynamic loader, which solves the slow behavior that the current (pre glibc 2.35) "old" algorithm falls into when the DSO set contains circular dependencies.

## Bug Description 
This performance issue was first reported in November 2014 [RFE: Improve performance of dynamic loader for deeply nested DSO dependencies](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17645) by Paulo Andrade. Recently MathWorks discovered that this  issue is affecting the shutdown performance of MATLAB and Simulink. The shutdown performance is degenerated release by release and even getting worse with recent versions of glibc prior to 2.35. From a most recent (2022) benchmark, the shutdown time of MATLAB and Simulink in a Debian 11 environment (glibc-2.31) is about 300 seconds with modern hardwares. This significantly affect user experience and CI workflows. We tested in house with this patch applied and enabled, and the shutdown time was reduced to less than 3 seconds with same hardwares that did the previous benchmark. 


## Patch sources
This patch contains a new implementation of _dl_sort_maps first introduced here [RFE: Improve performance of dynamic loader for deeply nested DSO dependencies](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17645) by Paulo Andrade in 2014 and later incorporated into the master branch of glibc 2.35 by Chung-Lin Tang <cltang@codesourcery.com> and Adhemerval Zanella <azanella@sourceware.org> in the following commit:

* https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;h=15a0c5730d1d5aeb95f50c9ec7470640084feae8. 

Mathworks modify the patch to remove the tunnable and set the new DFS sorting algorithm to the default behavior.

## Acknowledgement and thanks
Many thanks to the broader glibc team and particularly Paulo Andrade for reporting the issue and providing the original implemetation, Chung-Lin Tang and Adhemerval Zanella for incorporate the new sorting algorithm in glibc v2.35 and providing the original patch.

Subject: [PATCH 1/5] remove broken code path for easier code review

This patch is not necessary for the bug fix, just makes concurrency
code review easier (removes a data race and overflow from a broken
code path).

dlopen can oom crash anyway in _dl_resize_dtv and it's probably
better to crash than leave half setup modules around.

	* elf/dl-tls.c (_dl_add_to_slotinfo): OOM crash.
